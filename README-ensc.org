* Purpose

In the years I am running =dspam= on my site ,several issue arrived
which were solved locally.  As upstream development of =dspam= seems
to stuck, I decided to do things /right/ instead of applying only
small hacks.  So, this repository:

- fixes some issues (protocol errors, crashes, compiler warnings)

- refactors the hash-drv massively

- enhances the hash-drv and related utilities (e.g. create sparse
  files, use more efficient syscalls)

- adds a testsuite for my changes


It has the following limitations:

- requires C99, partly C11 language features

- focused on Linux (e.g. =O_CLOEXEC= =open(2)= flags, =fallocate()=
  syscall) and its tools (GNU gcc)

- linux kernel C formatting style
